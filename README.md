🚀 A button-controlled shooting game on a 16x4 LCD, built using the LPC2148 microcontroller!

🕹️ Game Overview
This is a three-level shooting game where the player must eliminate robots while avoiding humans. The game runs on an alphanumeric 16x4 LCD and is controlled using three buttons.

🎯 Gameplay Levels:
1️⃣ Level 1: Shoot 5 robots in 60 seconds to proceed.
2️⃣ Level 2: Robot speed increases, and time is reduced for an added challenge.
3️⃣ Level 3: Avoid shooting humans! Game over if a human is hit.

🔧 Technical Details
Microcontroller Used: LPC2148 (Hardware)
Simulation Tested On: LPC2124 (Proteus)
